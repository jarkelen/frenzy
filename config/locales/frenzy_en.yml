Later on, this will only be possible during the transfer periods. When e listbox of a certain league doesn't contain any clubs, then this means that there are no clubs anymore you can chose from. For example, if you only have 5 points left to spend and Chelsea has a value of 18 points, then Chelsea will not be in the list anymore."

      intro:            "The coming season there will again be a new Frenzy game! Till the start of the season at August 3rd you can change your team as much as you want. This page gives you an overview how to play the game, how you can score points and which rules there are. Have fun playing the Frenzy!"
      participation_title:  Participation
      participation1:   "On this site you can register your team via 'My team > My team' till the start of the new season. There is a maximum of 25 clubs you can select in your team (but can be less, that's up to you) from the Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two and/or Blue Square Premier League."
      participation2:   'There is no limit to the amount of clubs from a certain league, so Premier League fetishists can go crazy. Each club has a certain value which are based on the quotes at Ladbrokes. The exact quotes will be determined around Fixture Day at 19 June 2013. Below you see an overview of the value of each club per league position.'
      participation3:   'When selecting your team there is just one limitiation: the total value of your team is a maximum of 125 points. When you view the clubs overview you can see the value of each club per period. And also while selecting your team you will see the value of each club.'
      participation4:   'New this season is that new participants also can join when the new season already has started. A new participant who enters during the season will receive a relative number of jokers. After registration the participant has 3 days to select his team, after that it is not possible anymore to do this and he has to wait till the first upcoming transfer period.'
      points_title:     Scores
      points1:          The Frenzy has the following scoring rules
      points_score1:    3 points for a win of a club in your team
      points_score2:    1 point for a draw of a club in your team
      points_score3:    1 point per scored goal if a club in your team plays at home
      points_score4:    2 points per scored goal if a club in your team plays away
      points_score5:    1 penalty point per goal against
      points_example1_title: 'Example 1:'
      points_example1:   'You have Birmingham City in your team and they win at home from Charlton Athletic with 3-2: Birmingham scores 3 points for the win + 3 points for the amount of scored goals - 2 points for the amount of goals against = 4 points.'
      points_example2_title: 'Example 2:'
      points_example2:   'You have Gateshead in your team and lose away at Wrexham with 2-1: Gateshead scores 2 points for that single scored goal - 2 points for each goal against = 0 points.'
      jokers_title:     Jokers
      jokers1:          "At the start of the season every participant receives 40 jokers. You can assign these jokers during a gameround (with a maximum of 3 jokers per gameround) to one of your team's clubs. The score of that club will be doubled in that gameround because of the joker. But be aware: also negative scores will be doubled!"
      jokers2:          'You can decide for yourself if and when you want to assign jokers, the only limitation is a maximum of 3 jokers per gameround. You can assign jokers yourself under "My team > My jokers"'
      jokers3:          'Participants who register during the season will receive jokers related to the period in which they register:'
      jokers_period1:   'Period 1: 40 jokers'
      jokers_period2:   'Period 2: 30 jokers'
      jokers_period3:   'Period 3: 20 jokers'
      jokers_period4:   'Period 4: 10 jokers'
      transfers_title:  Transfer windows
      transfers1:       'During the season there will be 3 transfer windows in which you can change your team: transfer window 1 is in October, transfer window 2 is in January and transfer window 3 is in March. The exact dates will be announced loud and clear early on. At the start of a transfer window the new values of clubs will be decided by the then actual league tables.'
      transfers2:       "During a transfer window you have the possibility to change your team for several days. Each club you want to change has a certain value and you can use that value to select a new club. Suppose a club in your team has a value of 9 points, then you are allowed to select another club(s) with a (combined) maximum of 9 points. It can also be that you didn't use all you points before, so you can use these points now again. If a club in your team has done well, it will gain in value and you can use this extra value by changing the club. Example: you picked Bury at the start of the season and then they had a value of 4 points. Bury did well and stormed the table to a 6th place. Now they have a value of 18, so you gained a nice 14 points with Bury!"
      transfers3:        "In theory you can change your whole team during a transfer period, provided that the total new team value can't exceed the maximum team value. Changing your team can be done on this website. Chnaging your team in not mandatory. If you want you don't have to do anything after registration and selecting your initial team. But you will not win!"
      gamerounds_title:  Gamerounds
      gamerounds1:        "During the season there are 2 gamerounds per week, provided that there are matches planned. The weekend gameround consists of all matches played on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The midweek gameround consists of all played matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. A gameround therefore doesn't necessarily have to be the same as a gameround as stated on the football league websites."
      gamerounds2:        'We wont keep a list of match fixtures here, there are plenty of other websites, like the BBC, which are perfectly fine for that'
      small_title:       And finally
      small1:             'A match result is a match result when a score is published on the BBC website. Abandoned or postponed matches will not count and when you have assigned jokers for these matches they will be given back to you.'
      small2:             'If there is a situation not described in these rules, then the Frenzy Jury (@DoingThe116 and @DutchAddick) will take a decision. And of course this decision will be completely objective and fair.'
      small3:             'Participating with the Frenzy is totally on your own risk and by registering you agree that you will not hold organisers @DoingThe116 and @DutchAddick accountable or responsible for anything.'
      small4:             'We assume that each participant behaves normal and sees the Frenzy as a nice way to play a game with like minded football enthusiasts. If a participant not behaves normal , we as organisation will not hesitate to remove this participant.'
